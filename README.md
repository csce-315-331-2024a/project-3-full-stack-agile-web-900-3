Sprint 1 Plan:

Our Sprint 1 Goal-
During sprint 1, our goal is to get our web server successfully hosted and working. We will be using Spring Boot and Angularjs
as our framework through this project. We will successfully migrate our database schema into the new Postgres database created for
Project 3. We will be updating the values in our database to have smoother query responses when requesting data from our database.
After this intial setup, we will aim to have just the beggining of our different pages display as our MVP. Since many of us on this team
have exams coming up next week, we will be not be focusing on doing too much work since we will have plenty of time in the coming weeks.

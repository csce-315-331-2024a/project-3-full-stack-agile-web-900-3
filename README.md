Sprint 1 Plan:

Our Sprint 1 Goal-

During sprint 1, our goal is to get our web server successfully hosted and working. We will be using Spring Boot and Angularjs
as our framework through this project. We will successfully migrate our database schema into the new Postgres database created for
Project 3. We will be updating the values in our database to have smoother query responses when requesting data from our database.
After this initial setup, we will aim to have just the beginning of our different pages displayed as our MVP. Since many of us on this team
have exams coming up next week, we will not be focusing on doing too much work since we will have plenty of time in the coming weeks.

Sprint 2 Plan:

Our Sprint 2 Goal-

Our goal is to have near completion on basic functionality of all pages. This includes ordering functionality on both customer and cashier pages. The customer and cashier pages will have similar backend features so we will be able to reuse much of the backend code. These two pages will include the visual designs made in a consistent style. We will implement inventory management on the manager page and basic report features. This does not include the visual design of the manager page because that will be assigned to the last sprint.. The menu board will be completely designed and implemented other than the weather API that will be added in the last sprint. We will be split into small teams to work on each user and will combine to finish the harder parts of the manager page towards the end of the sprint.
